# Wordsworth

## Description
Wordsworth is a full-stack web application that provides flashcard functionality, designed to help users study more effectively. The backend is built using Spring Boot, while the frontend is under development using React. This repository contains the backend code, with the frontend repository to be added soon. Once available, a link to the frontend will be provided here: _I am currently learning React.js and building the frontend_.

The Wordsworth API allows users to create, manage, and review flashcard sets, and supports CRUD operations on individual flashcards. The system is built with scalability in mind, making it a practical tool for personal study sessions or use in educational environments.

### Why Wordsworth?
Wordsworth was created to combine my passion for software development with my need for effective study tools. This project serves as both a personal learning experience in modern web technologies and a practical application that I use for studying in college. 

The name "Wordsworth" was inspired by the famous poet William Wordsworth, as I wanted a scholarly and literary reference to reflect the app's educational purpose. As an avid reader, I found this name fitting for a tool designed to help expand vocabulary and knowledge.

## Prerequisites
To run Wordsworth, youâ€™ll need the following installed on your machine:
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL (for runtime database)

### 3. Configure the Database
Set up a PostgreSQL instance on your machine and update the connection details in the `application.properties` file, located in `src/main/resources/`.

Example configuration:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/wordsworth

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### 4. Run the Application
You can start the backend application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.
