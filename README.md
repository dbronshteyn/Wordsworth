# Wordsworth

## Description
Wordsworth is a full-stack web application that provides flashcard functionality, designed to help users study more effectively. The backend is built using Spring Boot, while the frontend is built using React. 

Wordsworth allows users to create, manage, and review flashcard sets, and supports CRUD operations on individual flashcards. Additionally, Wordsworth leverages the Llama 3.2 large language model to generate flashcards from a user-provided prompt.

### Why Wordsworth?
Wordsworth was created to combine my passion for software development with my need for effective study tools. This project serves as both a personal learning experience in modern web technologies and a practical application that I use for studying in college. 

The name "Wordsworth" was inspired by the famous poet William Wordsworth, as I wanted a scholarly and literary reference to reflect the app's educational purpose. As an avid reader, I found this name fitting for a tool designed to help expand vocabulary and knowledge.
